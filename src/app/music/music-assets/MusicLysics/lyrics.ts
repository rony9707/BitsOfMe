[00:00.92]The sun
[00:06.11]It burns the night
[00:11.16]The moon
[00:16.14]It breaks the sky
[00:21.68]Defining lines between the victims
[00:24.17]And what will soon become the prey
[00:26.92]I've given up on counting blessings
[00:29.37]The gods can judge me when I'm dead
[00:31.38]'Cause I cannot take this anymore
[00:33.59]I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox
[00:37.48](Lost in paradox)
[00:40.84]The feeling of hatred burns my soul
[00:43.74]I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox 
[00:47.44](Lost in paradox) 
[00:49.91]I may be crazy enough to break myself inside my head
[00:54.71]'Cause lately, I couldn't find these answеrs to live by instead
[00:59.58]Some will call it giving up
[01:02.69]I just call it gеtting lost in my own revenge
[01:04.79]Burning out and fading away
[01:15.17]I feel my eyes, they're paralyzed
[01:17.72]Beyond the path of civilized
[01:19.63]All that I had was the past
[01:21.75]Drown me out, what was once what I had
[01:23.19]Burn me out of my misery down to the ashes, ashes
[01:26.95]We all fall down to the ashes, carry on
[01:30.12]I've been gone from the place where I belong
[01:33.91]'Cause I cannot take this anymore
[01:36.02]I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox
[01:40.22](Lost in paradox)
[01:43.18]The feeling of hatred burns my soul
[01:45.65]I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox
[01:49.38](Lost in paradox)
[01:52.05]I may be crazy enough to break myself inside my head
[01:56.87]'Cause lately, I couldn't find these answers to live by instead
[02:01.78]Some will call it giving up
[02:04.29]I just call it getting lost in my own revenge
[02:10.79]I may be crazy enough to break myself inside my head
[02:15.56]'Cause lately, I couldn't find these answers to live by instead
[02:20.51]Some will call it giving up
[02:23.03]I just call it getting lost in my own revenge
[02:28.81]Burning out and fading away
[02:32.80]🎸🎸🎸🎸
[02:40.74]The moon
[02:45.72]It breaks the sky
[02:53.10](The sun) 逃れられない憎しみや悲しみに
[02:56.33]向き合うことは辛いけれど (it burns the night)
[03:04.19]過去の幸せを忘れるほど
[03:06.37]不幸な人間にはなりたくはない (the moon)
[03:09.07]進んでいくんだ 一歩ずつ進んでいくんだ (the moon)
[03:10.93]I may be crazy enough to break myself inside my head
[03:16.12]'Cause lately, I couldn't find these answers to live by instead
[03:20.79]Some will call it giving up
[03:23.51]I just call it getting lost in my own revenge
[03:29.90]I may be crazy enough to break myself inside my head (the sun)
[03:34.69]'Cause lately, I couldn't find these answers to live by instead (it burns the night)
[03:39.65]Some will call it giving up (the moon)
[03:42.61]I just call it getting lost in my own revenge (the moon)
[03:47.76]Burning out and fading away
[03:52.50]🎸🎸🎸🎸
